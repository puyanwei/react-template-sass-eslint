# React Template with SASS & ESlint Setup

This template is working off [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but with a few add ons setup.

-   SASS watchers scripted to work with `npm start`
-   ESlint setup with ES6 JS. To use `npm run lint`. MAke sure your [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) configuration accepts the ESlint config file. This is set to the [air bnb style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) guide.
-   [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is added to help with handling API calls
-   Prop-Types for stricter data handling
